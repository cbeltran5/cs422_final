# CS422 Final Project

**Install**
```
git clone https://github.com/cbeltran5/cs422_final.git
cd cs422_final
now you're there :)
```

**After you've made some changes, check to see what you've done.**
```
git status
```

**Make sure that nothing in the main branch has changed. This fetches all changes.**

```
git pull
```

**You might see something like CONFLICT in the terminal. Look at the file it's talking about, and look for things like '========', and it's ususally something you can fix yourself**

**Add all changes**

```
git add .
```

**Commit them**
```
git commit -m "A message of what you've done"
```

**Push them to the repo**
```
git push
```
