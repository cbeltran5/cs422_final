bug when changing the height to short, the ALarmON icon does not go down with the rest of the menu

//gabe.js
when changing user in radio buttons...

// not really a bug
if something will be done with Current_user, then look at switchActiveUser() in carlos.js, you'll have to update current_user. I also only supported 2 possible active users.

// possible TODO
addNewUser() in carlos.js, if we're supporting dynamic users

// BUG
bug in showTrafficSettings(), sometimes one of the blocks aren't rendered.

TODO
change abeer.js/MultiUsersFromInside() to dynamically add people to that list on runtime. possibly work with a fabric.text and fabric.rect for each user.
